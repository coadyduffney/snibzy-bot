# Snibzy-Bot
Snibzy-Bot is a side project I've been working on in my spare time. It's a discord bot developed using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/).  It's an all-in-one gaming bot with features for Fortnite, WoW, and OSRS - along with some other useful features, including a built-in music bot! <br>
